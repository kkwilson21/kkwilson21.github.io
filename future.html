<p>You have probably already read that I'm studying Business Management because I don't know what I want to do, career-wise. That is a big piece of my future that I have not planned for. Other than that, I have some other aspects figured out. I want to stay in Maine, probably back down south so I can be near all of my family. I'm not a city person, so somewhere in suburbia around Portland. I am not planning on going to grad school, or at least not right after UMaine. My master plan (so far) is to move back in with my parents for a year or so and start working so I can save up some money. Also figure out my life. No biggie. I would love to work for a clothing or home ware store. Style and design have always been a love of mine, and since I have no intentions of moving to New York, working the business side of this industry is the closet I am planning on getting. I've worked retail before, which isn't too great, but I've had my own fashion blog in the past and have dabbled in dress design. <br>
<br>
Although I plan on living in Maine, I am a big victim of the travel bug. I've already been to a lot of incredible places. I've been to Quebec hundreds of times, I've been to Egypt, Amsterdam, Spain, France, England, and about a quarter of the states. Some pictures from those trips are down below! I've always dreamed of going to Hawaii, so that is definitely top of my bucket list. I'd also love to go to northern Europe (Germany, Poland, Ireland, Scandinavia, etc), Japan, Australia/New Zealand, Russia, and Machu Picchu, as well as everywhere else on the planet. I'm not too picky.<br><br>

Aside from those, all I know is I want dogs.
